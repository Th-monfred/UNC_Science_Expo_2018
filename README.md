# Spurious correlations Shiny app for UNC's Science Expo 2018

This repository builds a Shiny app to demonstrate spurious correlations between UNC basketball data and other data (e.g. stock market trends, Duke basketball data, etc). This app was developed for the [UNC Science EXPO](http://moreheadplanetarium.org/programs/special-activities/unc-science-expo).

The app can be found at [**https://cbreen.shinyapps.io/final_app/**](https://cbreen.shinyapps.io/final_app/)*


This app was developed by

- [Colman Breen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coleman-breen-3a08a4103/)
- [Iain Carmichael](https://idc9.github.io/)
- [Jenny Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenny-chen-7b4a569b/)
- [Andrew Nobel](http://nobel.web.unc.edu/)

with support from the [Statistics and Operations Research Department](https://stat-or.unc.edu/), the National Science Foundation, the UNC Willis-Hanes Fund and the Vicki and David Craver Fund for Faculty Leadership.


### This repository


This repository contains the shiny app, the data sets and a number of script files which scrape and process some of the data.


- the UNC and Duke basketball data come from [https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/north-carolina/](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/north-carolina/)
- the stock market data comes from [http://www.1stock1.com/](http://www.1stock1.com/)
- a number of other data sets (e.g. hanging deaths) comes from [http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations](http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).

*Please note that the link to the app may be faulty if it has experienced a lot of traffic recently. Shiny apps have a cap on hours. However, all of the code needed to run the app on your own device can be found in this repository.
